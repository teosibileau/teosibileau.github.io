## Who am I?

My name is Teo Sibileau. This is my [:simple-linkedin: Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/te%C3%B3filo-sibileau-18800058/).

I'm a python developer with almost 20 years of experience architecting and scaling backend systems, particularly with Django and PostgreSQL. Proven track record across domains like satellite tasking, media platforms, and large-scale infrastructure migrations.

I'm based near El Bolsón, Río Negro, deep within the Argentinian Andes. I live with my wife and our 10 year old.

My life is split between my family, my work and a many other interests among which: **training and playing rugby, building infrastructure for my farm & everything about the guitar**. I document a lot of this on [:simple-instagram: Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teosibileau/).
