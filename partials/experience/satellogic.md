### [Satellogic](https://satellogic.com/) <small>Feb 2019 - Apr 2023</small>

Contributed to the design, development, and long-term maintenance of a mission planning system that allowed non-technical users to simulate, schedule, and deploy imaging tasks to Earth observation satellites. Migrated legacy systems and consolidated historical data into the new platform, enabling seamless transition and self-service planning capabilities for sales and internal users.

Maintained complex tasking state in a high-latency environment, reconciling planned activity with execution evidence from orbit, and implementing automated re-planning for failed image captures due to quality issues (e.g. cloud cover, blur). Collaborated with satellite operations and frontend teams to ensure accurate state sync and system reliability.

Led the phased migration of the system from Azure to AWS, including transitions of storage (to S3), message queues (to SQS), task workers, and databases (via DMS replication and cutover with minimal downtime). Worked closely with DevOps to adapt Helm charts and CI/CD pipelines to support dual-cloud operation during the transition.
