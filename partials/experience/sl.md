### [SibileauLang]() <small>2003 - Feb 2011</small>

During the golden era of Flash apps, I founded, managed, and eventually closed a two-person web design studio focused on building interactive web experiences. Most of the work involved crafting portfolio sites for artists and fulfilling contract work for media agencies looking for visually rich, custom-built solutions.

Development centered on building Flash applications and websites using ActionScript, with backend integration powered by the Django framework and the [easymode](https://github.com/specialunderwear/django-easymode) library. This approach allowed for seamless content management behind highly dynamic interfaces.

Thank you Steve for ['Thoughts on Flash'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37229212). No pun intended at all.
