### [Buenos Aires City Goverment](https://buenosaires.gob.ar) <small>Feb 2011 - Nov 2013</small>

Full time remote position at Buenos Aires City Ministry of Modernization

#### Responsibilities

Contracted to introduce Drupal as a solution for [buenosaires.gob.ar](https://buenosaires.gob.ar). Started working on-site early 2011, moved to a remote position by Jan 2012.  Started training non-php developers (and myself) to handle drupal work. By 2013 we managed to move 100% of all city content to the Drupal website together with search against a [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) instance.

Builded the first functional draft of a city wide OpendID SSO integrating countless internal goverment SOAP services to provide a single point of access for citizen goverment data. This end up being the foundations for what is now [miArgentina](https://id.argentina.gob.ar/)

Worked closely with the in-house IT department to start using [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) as a provisioning tool and design deployment processes that work with ease and align with their security standards.
