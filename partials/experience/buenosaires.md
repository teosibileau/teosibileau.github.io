### [Buenos Aires City Goverment](https://buenosaires.gob.ar) <small>Feb 2011 - Nov 2013</small>

Contracted to introduce Drupal as the content management solution for buenosaires.gob.ar. Began working on-site in early 2011, transitioning to a remote role by January 2012. Led training efforts for non-PHP developers (and myself) to build internal Drupal expertise. By 2013, successfully migrated 100% of city content to the Drupal platform, with integrated search powered by Apache Solr.

Developed the first functional prototype of a city-wide OpenID-based SSO system, integrating numerous internal government SOAP services to provide citizens with unified access to government services and personal data. This system laid the groundwork for what later became miArgentina.

Collaborated closely with the cityâ€™s in-house IT department to introduce Ansible as a provisioning tool and helped design secure, streamlined deployment processes aligned with municipal standards.
