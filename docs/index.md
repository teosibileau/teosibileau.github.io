# Hi!

![Teo](./img/teo.jpeg)

## Who am I?

I'm a python developer with almost 20 years of experience. I've worked on a wide range of projects, from small websites to large scale data processing pipelines.

I'm based near El Bolsón, Río Negro, deep within the Argentinian Andes. I live with my wife and 8 year old. Not willing to relocate, only interested in remote positions. **Here's why:**

My life is split between my family, my work and a many other interests among which: **training and playing rugby, building infrastructure for my farm & everything about the guitar**

## Code 

I mainly use [:borrowed-gitlab: Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/teosibileau/projects) now, but i have a few projects on [:borrowed-github: Github](https://github.com/teosibileau). Here's a selection:
